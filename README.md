# Walk the Dog
## Description
An endless runner where you play as a boy walking his dog through the forest when your dog is surprised by the cat that runs by and starts chasing it. You then begin chasing your dog through the forest, dodging obstacles along the way, until you crash into one and fall down. At which point the dog turns around to check on you (obviously).

## What does each file do?

* `Cargo.toml` contains the standard Rust metadata. You put your Rust dependencies in here. You must change this file with your details (name, description, version, authors, categories)

* `package.json` contains the standard npm metadata. You put your JavaScript dependencies in here. You must change this file with your details (author, name, version)

* `webpack.config.js` contains the Webpack configuration. You shouldn't need to change this, unless you have very special needs.

* The `js` folder contains your JavaScript code (`index.js` is used to hook everything into Webpack, you don't need to change it).

* The `src` folder contains your Rust code.

* The `static` folder contains any files that you want copied as-is into the final build. It contains an `index.html` file which loads the `index.js` file.

* The `tests` folder contains your Rust unit tests.
